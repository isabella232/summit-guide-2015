## Your guide to the city of Denver for Summer Summit 2015



## Requirements

- [npm](https://nodejs.org/download)
- [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started)

## Installation

For command line help, visit our wiki page on Bourbon’s [command line interface](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon/wiki/Command-Line-Interface).

1. Install Ionic and the project dependencies

  ```bash
  npm install
  bower install
  ```

2. Run the Ionic server

  Run the Ionic server for the desktop version:

  ```bash
  ionic serve
  ```

  Or preview the iOS and Android versions in your browser:

  ```bash
  ionic serve --lab
  ```

  Then run this command to keep your build files updated:

  ```bash
  gulp watch
  ```

3. Get Coding

  All of the Haml, Sass and Coffeescript files are located in the `source`
  directory. They will autogenerate to the `www` folder, so you won't need to
  edit anything there. Some configuration files also live at the root of the
  project, such as `gulpfile.js` and `package.json`.
